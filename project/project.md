## Final Project


As a significant portion of your grade, the Course Project provide you the chance to flex your newly acquired skills toward an application of your choosing. What is more, people from different background are encouraged to form a team. 

This is a group project. All team members will receive the same grade. This project will account for 30% of the overall grade. 

You may conduct investigative analysis on any one of the following topics related to text mining:
* Text classification
* Text clustering
* Opining mining and sentiment analysis
* Information Extraction
* Other topics are possible with consent from the instructor.

Note that reports and required files/documents handed in after the due date will be marked down by 10% per day.
